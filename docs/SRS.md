The system will be designed for scalability, reliability, and maintainability, adhering to MLOps best practices, all within the constraints of open-source solutions.

**2.2 Product Features**

The ML system will include the following core features, implemented using open-source alternatives:

* **Data Ingestion and Engineering:** Ability to ingest data from various sources, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, and store data in a structured format (e.g., using Pandas, Dask).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creation of relevant features from raw data to improve model performance (e.g., using Scikit-learn, Featuretools).
* **Model Training and Evaluation:** Training of an ML model using appropriate open-source algorithms (e.g., Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, PyTorch), evaluating its performance using relevant metrics, and selecting the best-performing model.
* **Model Deployment:** Deployment of the trained model as a batch inference job or a real-time endpoint (e.g., using Flask, Docker, Kubernetes).
* **Model Monitoring:** Monitoring of model performance over time and triggering retraining or redeployment as needed (e.g., using MLflow, Prometheus).
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the ML system components using open-source tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
* **Feature Store:** Centralized repository for storing and managing features (e.g., using Feast, Hopsworks).
* **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Monitoring of the underlying infrastructure for performance and availability (e.g., using Prometheus, Grafana).
* **Model and Data Monitoring:** Monitoring of model performance and data quality (e.g., using Evidently AI, Great Expectations).
* **Model Registry:** Centralized repository for managing trained models and their versions (e.g., using MLflow Model Registry).

**2.3 User Classes and Characteristics**
